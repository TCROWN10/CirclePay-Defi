## 💬 User Experience

### Sample Conversation Flow

**User**: *"I want to put $10,000 to work but keep it safe"*

**🤖 SageFi**: *"Perfect! Let me analyze safe options across all chains..."*

*[Chainlink Price Feeds checking rates...]*

*"Found 3 excellent safe strategies:
1. Aave Multi-Chain: 4.5% APY across ETH/ARB/BASE
2. Stablecoin Farming: 5.2% APY with auto-rebalancing  
3. Conservative LP: 6.1% APY with lower risk pairs

Want details on any of these?"*

**User**: *"Tell me about the multi-chain option"*

**🤖 SageFi**: *"Great choice! Here's the breakdown:
• $4,000 → Ethereum Aave (4.2% APY)
• $3,000 → Arbitrum Aave (4.6% APY)  
• $3,000 → Base Moonwell (4.8% APY)

Diversified across 3 chains for safety
Monthly rebalancing with Chainlink automation
Easy exit anytime, no lock-up period

Ready to execute? I'll handle all the cross-chain setup."*
